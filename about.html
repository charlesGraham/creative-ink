          <p>
          Hello! I'm Charles. I'm a SoCal native, moving back-and-forth between the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego as I grew up. Ultimately, my family settled in San Diego permanently when I started high school; I attended Mira Mesa High. Though I had dreams of the NBA, my genetics would fail me in the end, leaving me without much hope of pursuing that endeavor. Luckily, while contemplating new career paths during freshman year, I found my high school's hip-hop dance group to be an enjoyable alternative to the basketball team. Because I grew up with only one computer in the household, I was amazed at how many computers were readily available for casual use or research whenever I was at school or the library. I found myself always wanting to figure out how they worked, how the movement of the mouse translated to a cursor moving on the screen or how the computer knew what to do when I clicked an icon or pressed a button on the keyboard. While early on, becoming a professional hip-hop dancer sounded exceedingly attractive, this captivation with computer technology is what pushed me to pursue a coding career -- especially when weighing each industry's career stabilities against each other. In any case, after a tumultuous couple of years after high school, I was finally able to transfer to UC San Diego, where web development became my area of focus. The unique challenges involved with actualizing a business concept online spoke to me; which brings me to where I am professionally, today. CreativeInk Studios was initially formed to house and promote my own artistic passion projects. Now, I've decided to share my know-how with creatives all over, in hopes of helping them build an online presence for their art, content, business, etc. Maybe I can do the same for you!
          
          <br>
          <br>

          When not working, I enjoy activities that take me off the computer. Like most, I did some form of "kids karate" in my youth, which lately has exploded into a genuine love for martial arts. You're most likely to find me taking class at 10th Planet San Diego. Aside from Jiu-Jitsu, I love working out (just for general health and fitness) and taking advantage of our San Diego weather.
